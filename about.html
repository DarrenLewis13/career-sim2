  <h1>When I am not focusing on school or work,
    these three things keep me motivated. </h1>

    <ol>
      <li><h2 class="LI">Travel</h2></li>
      <p>Travel is a captivating and enriching experience that opens up a world of possibilities.
         Whether it's venturing to a bustling, vibrant city, immersing oneself in the serene beauty 
         of nature, or uncovering the unique cultural traditions of a foreign land, the act of travel
        invites us to step outside our comfort zones and embrace the unknown. As we journey to new destinations, 
        we are afforded the opportunity to broaden our perspectives, challenge our preconceptions, and cultivate 
        a deeper appreciation for the diversity that exists across the globe. Through travel, we can forge meaningful 
        connections with people from all walks of life, learn from their customs and beliefs, and return home with a 
        renewed sense of wonder and curiosity about the world around us.</p>

       <li><h2 class="LI">Golf</h2></li>
       <p>Golf is a captivating and multifaceted sport that has enthralled players and spectators alike for centuries.
         At its core, golf is a game of precision, patience, and strategy, where players navigate a carefully manicured 
         landscape of lush fairways, meticulously groomed greens, and treacherous bunkers, all while wielding an array 
         of specialized clubs designed to propel a small, resilient ball great distances with pinpoint accuracy. </p>

       <li><h2 class="LI">Family/Friends</h2>
       <p>Family is a fundamental and multifaceted concept that encompasses the core relationships and bonds that shape 
        our lives from the moment we are born. At its most basic level, family refers to the group of individuals, typically 
        connected by blood, marriage, or adoption, who provide a child with their first and most influential social environment. 
        From parents and siblings to extended relatives, each family member plays a distinct role in nurturing a child's physical, 
        emotional, and social development. </p>
